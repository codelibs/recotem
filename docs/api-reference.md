# recotem v1 API Reference

Authoritative reference for the v1 HTTP surface mounted under `/v1`.

## Authentication

All endpoints except `/v1/health` require the `X-API-Key` header.  See
`docs/security.md` for key rotation procedures.

## Endpoints

### `POST /v1/recipes/{name}:recommend`
Single-user recommendation.

**Path parameters:** `name` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$` (same as the
recipe-name constraint enforced by the recipe loader).

**Request body:**

| field | type | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | string | yes | – | 1-256 chars |
| `limit` | int | no | 10 | 1..1000 |
| `exclude_items` | string[] \| null | no | null | ≤1000 items |
| `user_features` | object \| null | no | null | Raw feature values, keyed by the recipe's `features.user` column names. See [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start) below. ≤64 keys. |

**Response body:** see `RecommendResponse` in `src/recotem/serving/schemas.py`.

**Status codes:** 200, 400 (`FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED` | `FEATURE_VALUE_UNUSABLE`), 401, 404 (`UNKNOWN_USER` | `RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`), 422 (`VALIDATION_ERROR`), 503 (`RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE`).

### `POST /v1/recipes/{name}:recommend-related`
Seed-item → items.

**Request body:**

| field | type | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `seed_items` | string[] | yes | – | 1-100 items |
| `limit` | int | no | 10 | 1..1000 |
| `exclude_items` | string[] \| null | no | null |  |
| `user_features` | object \| null | no | null | Raw feature values, keyed by the recipe's `features.user` column names. Adds a profile prior to the seed-history solve. See [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start). ≤64 keys. |
| `item_features` | object[string, object] \| null | no | null | Raw feature values for seed items absent from training, keyed by seed item id. ≤100 keys; each value ≤64 keys. See [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start). |

**Status codes:** 200, 400 (`FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED` | `FEATURE_VALUE_UNUSABLE`), 401, 404 (`UNKNOWN_SEED_ITEMS` | `NO_CANDIDATES` | `RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`), 422 (`VALIDATION_ERROR`), 503 (`RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE`).

`UNKNOWN_SEED_ITEMS` means none of the supplied `seed_items` were known
to the model id-map (typically a client-side data issue).
`NO_CANDIDATES` means at least one seed was known but the ranker did not
produce any survivors after its internal filtering — typically a data
distribution issue rather than a client mistake. `NO_CANDIDATES` is only
possible on the pre-existing "all seeds known, no features supplied" path;
see [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start) for why the two
feature-aware branches never raise it.

### `POST /v1/recipes/{name}:batch-recommend`
Multi-user batch.  Body: `{ "requests": RecommendRequest[], "include_metadata": bool }` (1..256).
Response: `BatchRecommendResponse`.  Per-element `status` ∈ {ok, error}.
HTTP 200 on partial failure; HTTP 503 only when the recipe itself is
unavailable.

Each element accepts `user_features` exactly as the single `:recommend`
endpoint does (see [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start));
an element whose model has no matching feature state surfaces as
`status=error, code=FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED` rather than failing the whole
batch.

`include_metadata` (default `false`): when `true`, each `ok` result
includes per-item metadata fields (same join as the single-recommend
endpoint).  Default `false` preserves the performance-first default for
bulk callers.

The aggregate `sum(requests[].limit)` must not exceed **5000**.  When a
sub-request would push the running aggregate over the cap, that element
surfaces as `status=error, code=VALIDATION_ERROR` and processing of
subsequent elements continues — earlier elements are unaffected.  The
list size cap (1..256) is enforced at the schema level (whole-request
422 if violated); per-element schema failures are surfaced per-element
so a single bad entry never 422s the whole batch.

**Status codes:** 200, 401, 404 (`RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`), 422 (`VALIDATION_ERROR` — only for whole-request shape, e.g. missing `requests` key, list too large), 503 (`RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE`).

> **Note:** batch endpoints return `{item_id, score}` only by default
> (`include_metadata=false`).  Set `include_metadata: true` to include
> per-item metadata fields (same join as single-recommend endpoints).
> Be aware that metadata enrichment increases response size; for bulk callers
> that do not need metadata the default `false` is recommended.

### `POST /v1/recipes/{name}:batch-recommend-related`
Multi-seed batch.  Body: `{ "requests": RecommendRelatedRequest[], "include_metadata": bool }` (1..256).
Same aggregate-limit, per-element validation rules, and `include_metadata`
semantics as `:batch-recommend`.

**Cold-seed solve cap.** This verb carries a *second* aggregate cap that
`:batch-recommend` does not need. Case C runs one solve per cold seed, so
the aggregate count of cold seeds — `sum` over elements of the seeds named
in that element's `item_features` — must not exceed **512**. An element
that would push the running total over the cap surfaces as `status=error,
code=VALIDATION_ERROR`, exactly like the aggregate-`limit` cap, and later
elements continue to be processed.

The two caps guard different dimensions and neither subsumes the other:
`sum(limit)` bounds response volume, while this bounds solver work. A batch
of `limit: 1` elements sits at 2% of the aggregate-`limit` cap while
demanding 25,600 solves. The count is taken from the request alone — a seed
named in `item_features` counts even if it turns out to be a known item
whose learned embedding is used instead — so the same body is always
accepted or rejected identically, regardless of which model is loaded.

A single `:recommend-related` call cannot reach this cap: `seed_items` is
capped at 100, so a maximal single request is 100 solves.

Each element accepts `user_features` / `item_features` exactly as the
single `:recommend-related` endpoint does, including the case A/B/C
precedence rules and the `200 {"items": []}` vs `NO_CANDIDATES` asymmetry
described in [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start) — both
apply per-element here.

**Status codes:** 200, 401, 404 (`RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`), 422 (`VALIDATION_ERROR` — only for whole-request shape), 503 (`RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE`).

### `GET /v1/recipes`
Authenticated.  Returns `RecipesListResponse` with one entry per loaded
recipe.

### `GET /v1/recipes/{name}`
Authenticated.  Returns `RecipeDetailResponse` or 404 (`RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`).

**Status codes:** 200, 401, 404 (`RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`), 503 (`RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE`).

### `GET /v1/health`
Unauthenticated.  Returns `{status, total, loaded}`.  Body status is
`"ok"` when every registered recipe is loaded, `"degraded"` otherwise.
The HTTP response code mirrors body status: **200 OK** when ok, **503
Service Unavailable** when degraded — so K8s readiness probes pointing
at this endpoint mark the pod NotReady whenever any recipe is
unloaded.

### `GET /v1/health/details`
Authenticated.  Returns `{status, recipes: {name: health}}`.  Same 200
/ 503 status-code rule as `/v1/health`.

### `GET /v1/metrics`
Prometheus exposition.  Excluded from OpenAPI.  Requires
`RECOTEM_METRICS_ENABLED` to be truthy at startup.

**Requires `X-API-Key`** — configure your Prometheus scraper with an
`authorization` block or `http_headers` accordingly.

## Feature-aware cold start

`user_features` and `item_features` are only meaningful against a model
trained with a [`features:`](recipe-reference.md#features) block. They are
accepted (and validated) on every model, but a model with no matching
feature state (or whose search winner is not feature-capable — see
`docs/recipe-reference.md#features`) responds `400 FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED`
rather than silently ignoring the field or guessing.

Three cold-start cases, spread across two verbs:

| Case | Verb | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — unknown user, features only | `:recommend` | `user_id` unknown, `user_features` present | Scores every known item against the profile alone (no interaction history exists yet for this user). |
| B — unknown user, features + ad-hoc history | `:recommend-related` | `user_features` present | Runs the same seed-history solve as the pre-existing path, with the profile added as a joint prior. This is a genuine joint solve, not either/or: it correlates with neither a features-only nor a history-only score alone. |
| C — unknown seed item(s) | `:recommend-related` | one or more `seed_items` absent from training, and a matching entry in `item_features` | Computes each cold seed's embedding from its features, averages it with the known seeds' learned embeddings, and scores as item-item similarity. |

If a request supplies both a cold seed's `item_features` **and**
`user_features` on `:recommend-related`, case C wins: a cold seed has no row
in the seed-history matrix that case B's solve uses, so running case B alone
would silently drop that seed's contribution. Case C is the only path that
can actually use a cold seed's features.

**A known `user_id` with `user_features` supplied is not an error.** The
learned embedding from that user's real interaction history strictly
dominates a profile prior, so the server always prefers it and simply
**ignores** the supplied `user_features` — it does not reject the request.
This lets a client always send the user's profile on every request without
needing to know in advance whether the user is new or returning.

**Unknown feature values degrade, they do not fail the request.** What
"degrade" means, and whether `recotem_v1_feature_unknown_value_total` (see
[operations.md](operations.md#feature-aware-ials-sizing)) actually catches
it, differs by encoding:

- `categorical` — a value absent from the training vocabulary encodes to an
  all-zero segment for that column, and the counter increments.
- `multi_label` — each token is looked up independently: known tokens are
  retained (each contributing exactly one `1.0` to its dimension, even if
  the token is repeated in the input — see the multi-hot note below),
  unknown tokens are dropped. The counter increments whenever **any**
  supplied token misses the vocabulary, even if other tokens in the same
  value are known. A mixed value such as `"Action|Thrller"` sets the bit
  for the known token, drops `Thrller`, and still increments the counter —
  a partial typo is caught, not silently absorbed.
- `numerical` — a **missing** value (absent, `null`, or `NaN`) or a value
  that fails to parse as a number at all contributes nothing to the row,
  equivalent to encoding the standardized mean (`0`), and does **not**
  increment the counter. A value that DOES parse as a number but is
  **non-finite** (`Infinity` / `-Infinity` — valid in JSON per Python's
  parser extension — or a `NaN` reached via a string like `"nan"`) also
  contributes nothing to the row, but this case **does** increment the
  counter: it is a real, present value the server could not use, not an
  absent one.

Do not rely on this counter as a general typo detector for `numerical`
columns: a **missing or unparseable** value still degrades the
recommendation with no signal at all — only the non-finite case above is
covered. `categorical` and `multi_label` are both reliably covered.

`multi_label` is multi-**hot**, not a count vector: `"rock|pop|rock"`
contributes `1.0` to the `rock` dimension, not `2.0` — duplicate tokens in
one value are deduplicated before encoding, both at training time and for a
cold-start request's `item_features` / `user_features`.

**A large `numerical` value degrades silently across a wide range; only the
extreme tail is a hard 400.** Unlike the missing/unparseable case above, a
`numerical` value is standardized at serve time by dividing the raw request
value by the column's *training* mean/std — a fit the request's own value
was never part of (see the "Training is unaffected" note below for why that
matters). Nothing clamps how large the resulting magnitude may get, so
behavior is NOT a clean two-way split ("normal" vs. "hard 400"). An actual
sweep against a column with training std ≈ 0.425 found:

| value | result |
|---|---|
| `0.3` | `200`, small, normal-looking score |
| `100` | `200`, but the score is already visibly degenerate (order alone, no longer proportional to the profile) |
| `1e6` – `1e18` | `200`, score grows without bound (into the hundreds of millions and beyond) as the value grows |
| ~`1e19`+ | `400 FEATURE_VALUE_UNUSABLE` — only here does irspack's per-request cold-start solver itself give up |

So roughly `1e2` through `1e18` in this measurement is a **silent degrade**:
`200`, an unbounded and effectively meaningless score, a fixed/degenerate
ranking — and none of these finite values touch
`recotem_v1_feature_unknown_value_total` (per the counter note above, that
counter fires for a `numerical` value only when it is non-finite), so
nothing server-side signals that this happened either. The 400 only fires
once the standardized magnitude is large enough to make the underlying
conjugate-gradient solve singular; **the exact crossover is not a fixed
constant** — it depends on the column's training std and the BLAS
implementation solving the system, so do not hard-code a boundary value
(e.g. `1e22`) as a contract.

**The 400's `detail` message describes the standardized value, not the
client's raw one — because the raw value need not be extreme.** A column
whose training std is small enough (see the near-constant-column note
below) can make an ordinary raw value like `10000` standardize to a
magnitude that breaks the solver, exactly like `1e22` does against a
normal-sized std. The `detail` string therefore never claims the supplied
value itself was extreme; it says the resulting *standardized* value was
numerically unusable for this model's cold-start scoring, which is true
regardless of which side (raw magnitude vs. tiny std) produced it.

**A near-constant column is a special case of a small std, not a separate
bug — and training floors the most common cause of it.** A column whose
values are "the same number" up to floating-point rounding noise (e.g.
`std ≈ 1.36e-15`, not exactly `0.0`) would otherwise divide serve-time
standardization by a near-zero denominator, turning a routine value like
`10000` into an astronomically large standardized one — an ordinary client
value producing a 400 for a reason the client cannot see. `build_encoder_state`
(`_features.py`) floors a numerical column's training-time std to zero
whenever it is no larger than a relative tolerance of the column's own
scale (`1e-8 × max(abs(mean), 1.0)`) — tight enough to preserve real,
intentional small variance while absorbing realistic floating-point
rounding noise. A column caught by this floor never reaches the
standardization divide at all: it degrades exactly like a missing value
(logged once as `feature_zero_variance_column`), never a 400. This is a
**training-time behavior change**: a column that previously stood a chance
of triggering `FEATURE_VALUE_UNUSABLE` for a near-constant reason now never
does. It does not eliminate the phenomenon in general — a column with
genuine (not rounding-noise) small variance just above the floor still
standardizes an ordinary value to an unusable magnitude by the same
mechanism as the sweep above, which is exactly why the `detail` message
above is worded the way it is rather than promising the raw value was at
fault.

**Clamping the standardized magnitude before it reaches the solver — which
would close the silent-degrade band above — was deliberately deferred, not
overlooked.** Picking a clamp bound (how many training standard deviations
is "too many") is a modelling decision that changes what every downstream
consumer of the same encoding sees, including training, not a bugfix to the
400 path added here; it was intentionally scoped out of this fix. This
deferral was previously disclosed nowhere — this paragraph is that
disclosure.

Training is unaffected either way: the same value flowing through
training-time encoding is untouched by this guard, which only wraps the
serve-time cold-start solve. (Training has its own, much stronger bound: a
numerical column's training-time mean/std are computed from the same values
being standardized, so an outlier inflates the very std it is divided by —
this caps the worst-case training-time standardized magnitude at roughly
`(n_rows - 1) / sqrt(n_rows)` no matter how extreme the raw value is, which
is nowhere near the magnitude needed to break the solver. Serve-time has no
such self-bound, because the request's value is standardized against a
std fit without it.)

**A pre-existing API asymmetry, documented rather than fixed.**
`:recommend-related`'s original all-seeds-known branch (no `user_features`,
no cold seeds) returns `404 NO_CANDIDATES` when the ranker produces zero
survivors after its own filtering. The two feature-aware branches (B and C)
never raise `NO_CANDIDATES` — an empty result from either comes back as
`200 {"items": []}`. `:recommend` never had a `NO_CANDIDATES` code at all and
returns `200`/`[]` in every case, so it is internally consistent already;
`:recommend-related` is the one verb where the behavior differs by branch.
This was a deliberate call, not an oversight: for a cold-start profile or a
cold seed item, producing nothing is a property of an unproven input, not
evidence that the ranker itself failed — so `200 {"items": []}` was judged
the more defensible response. If your client treats an empty
`:recommend-related` result as actionable (e.g. falling back to
popularity-based recommendations), branch on `items == []` rather than on
HTTP status for this verb.

## Headers

- `X-Request-ID` — accepted (regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}$`) or generated;
  always echoed in the response.  When missing or invalid the server
  substitutes a 12-char hex string.  Handlers read the validated value
  from `request.state.request_id`, so the body field and response header
  always agree.
- `X-Recotem-Model-Version` — present on every successful recommend
  response; mirrors `model_version` in the body.
- `X-Recotem-Items-Degraded` — present on `:recommend` and
  `:recommend-related` responses only when one or more items could not be
  fully serialized with metadata.  The value is the total count of items
  that fell back to bare `{item_id, score}` (fallback) or were omitted
  entirely (dropped) due to metadata serialization failures.  Absent when
  all items serialize cleanly.  **Not sent** on `:batch-recommend` or
  `:batch-recommend-related` endpoints.

## Error body shape

All v1 error responses share a flat envelope at the top of the body:

```json
{"detail": "<human-readable message>", "code": "<MACHINE_CODE>"}
```

There is no nested `{"detail": {"detail": ..., "code": ...}}` form —
clients parse `body["detail"]` and `body["code"]` directly.

**422 validation errors** add a per-field breakdown from FastAPI /
Pydantic and include the request ID so the body is correlatable with the
`X-Request-ID` response header:

```json
{
  "request_id": "<id matching X-Request-ID>",
  "detail": "Request validation failed",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "errors": [{"loc": ["body", "limit"], "msg": "...", "type": "..."}]
}
```

**500 unhandled errors** flatten to:

```json
{"detail": "internal error", "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR"}
```

Each endpoint above lists the status codes it can emit; the body shape
in every error case is one of the three forms above.

## Error Code Table

| code | HTTP | when |
|---|---|---|
| `RECIPE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | recipe not loaded |
| `RECIPE_NOT_FOUND`   | 404 | no such recipe in registry |
| `UNKNOWN_USER`       | 404 | user not in idmap |
| `UNKNOWN_SEED_ITEMS` | 404 | none of seed_items known to model |
| `NO_CANDIDATES`      | 404 | seeds known, but ranker produced no survivors (only reachable on `:recommend-related`'s non-feature-aware path — see [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start)) |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR`   | 422 | Pydantic schema rejected the request (also used per-element inside batch responses) |
| `FEATURES_NOT_SUPPORTED` | 400 | `user_features` / `item_features` supplied but the model has no matching feature state, or its search winner is not feature-capable (also used per-element inside batch responses) |
| `FEATURE_VALUE_UNUSABLE` | 400 | a supplied `numerical` feature value, once standardized against the column's training mean/std, is large enough to make irspack's cold-start solver itself fail (the exact threshold is std/BLAS-dependent, not a fixed constant, and depends on the column's std as much as the raw value — see [Feature-aware cold start](#feature-aware-cold-start)) — the model and feature side both support cold start, but this particular value does not. Values large enough to be meaningless but not large enough to break the solver degrade silently as `200` instead (also used per-element inside batch responses) |
| `MISSING_API_KEY`    | 401 | `X-API-Key` header missing |
| `INVALID_API_KEY`    | 401 | `X-API-Key` header present but did not match any configured digest (also covers short-key / oversize-key rejections so callers cannot fingerprint the guard) |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR`     | 500 / batch | unhandled server-side exception, or unexpected recommender internal layout (`recommender_layout_unexpected`) — status=500 on single endpoints; per-element `status=error` inside batch responses |

All v1 codes use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
